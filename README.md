# The Semmelweis Handwashing Discovery

This project revisits a pivotal moment in medical history: Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis's discovery of the importance of handwashing in preventing childbed fever in the mid-19th century. Despite facing opposition and skepticism from his peers, Semmelweis's work at the Vienna General Hospital revealed a simple yet groundbreaking solution to a deadly problem. This analysis aims to demonstrate the impact of his discovery using data analysis techniques.

## Data Exploration

The journey begins by examining the yearly data on births and deaths at the Vienna General Hospital's two clinics. A disturbingly high number of women were dying from childbed fever, a fact that becomes evident upon calculating the proportion of deaths. The data indicates a significant disparity in mortality rates between the two clinics, with Clinic 1 showing alarmingly higher rates.

## Initial Observations

A detailed comparison of the two clinics over several years reveals that Clinic 1, where medical students who also worked in autopsy rooms served, had a significantly higher proportion of deaths than Clinic 2, staffed by midwives. This discrepancy led Semmelweis to hypothesize that something transferred from the cadavers, via the hands of medical students, was causing the increased mortality.

## Intervention and Analysis

Upon implementing mandatory handwashing in 1847, a dramatic decrease in mortality rates was observed. The analysis of monthly data before and after this intervention clearly shows the effectiveness of handwashing in reducing the proportion of deaths.

## Statistical Evidence

To quantify the impact of handwashing, the difference in mean monthly proportion of deaths before and after the intervention is calculated, showing an average reduction of about 8 percentage points. Furthermore, a bootstrap analysis provides a 95% confidence interval, reinforcing the significance of Semmelweis's handwashing policy.

## Legacy and Conclusion

Despite the compelling evidence, Semmelweis's discovery was met with resistance and was not widely accepted during his lifetime. This analysis not only highlights the tragic rejection of a simple yet lifesaving medical practice but also underscores the importance of data analysis in validating scientific discoveries.

Semmelweis's insistence on handwashing, validated through this reanalysis, stands as a testament to his pioneering contribution to hygiene and public health. It's a stark reminder of the challenges innovators face in overcoming established norms and the critical role of data in effecting change.

In conclusion, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis's early advocacy for handwashing in medical settings has been vindicated by history, marking a seminal moment in the advancement of medical science and public health.
